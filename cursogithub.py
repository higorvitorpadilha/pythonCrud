The video title "Existia controle de versão antes do Git?" is a good question to ask as a DevOps manager. It's important to understand the history of version control systems in order to make informed decisions about which system to use for a particular project.

Version control systems have been around for a long time, and Git is not the first one. In fact, there are many different version control systems available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

When choosing a version control system for a project, it's important to consider the following factors:

* The size and complexity of the project
* The number of developers who will be working on the project
* The level of collaboration required
* The need for branching and merging
* The need for a distributed system

Once you've considered these factors, you can start to narrow down your choices. If you need a system that is easy to use and doesn't require a lot of configuration, then Git is a good option. However, if you need a system that is more scalable and can handle large projects with multiple developers, then you might want to consider a different system, such as Mercurial or Subversion.
